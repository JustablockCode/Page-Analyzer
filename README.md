## This is javascript code for the browser console that will use Mubilop's API(thanks to him:)) to tell GPT the contents of the page and return the analyzed string.
### Getting code:
You can just copy code.js file, you can copy short PASTETHIS.js file or you can copy this: `fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustablockCode/Page-Analyzer/main/code.js').then(res => res.text()).then(eval);`

### Usage:
1. Open console(on windows: ctr + shift + i and then press console)
2. Paste the code into the browser console.
3. Press enter.
4. Input additional string(optional)
5. Wait for GPT to answer!

If you find any bugs then report them in the issues tab!
Also, it uses GPT-4o for the fastest and best answers.
